# Best Fit Line Calculator

This Flutter application allows users to calculate and visualize the best-fit line for a set of points using linear regression. The app provides an interactive interface where users can enter points, adjust the graph's axes, and view the regression line along with its equation and correlation coefficient (R-value).

## Features

- Input points as `(x, y)` coordinates separated by semicolons (e.g., `1,2; 3,4; 5,6`).
- Automatically calculates the best-fit line using linear regression.
- Displays the equation of the line (`y = mx + c`) and the R-value.
- Interactive controls to adjust the minimum and maximum values of the X and Y axes.
- Visualizes the input points and the best-fit line on a graph.
- Gives feedback whether a linear model would be suitable for the data or not.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: Framework for building the UI.
- **FL Chart**: Library for creating the chart visualizations.
- **Dart**: Programming language used for development.
